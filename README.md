"When Should Jeremy Visit?"

Post-bootcamp, I'm interested in building on my machine learning skills while studying more about them (and job hunting!).

My first idea is based around my friend Jeremy. He's a native Floridian, and as such, cannot stand cold weather. Being from Illinois
and living in Minneapolis, cold weather to me is anything a few degrees above 0 C, but for Jeremy, he's gotta have things at at least
20 C or else it's far too cold for him.

But, I'd love him and his family to visit some day. So, can I predict when the best timeframe is for Jeremy to visit Minneapolis?
That is, can I predict when the hottest days of the year will be, giving me the best chance to get Jermey to visit?
